          Howdy! My name is Jack and I am from Flower Mound Texas. I came to Texas
          A&M University to study Computer engineering, and I chose computer engineering
          because I liked programming but also wanted to learn more about hardware. I am 
          very passionate about the things that I learn in class and have been very happy 
          with my decision to choose computer engineering as my major. My favorite class 
          so far has been my computer architecture class where I got the opportunity to 
          build a functioning CPU using Verilog. More details about that project are listed 
          in the portfolio section of this website. My interest in computer engineering came 
          from my passion for building computers. I had built computers for myself and my 
          friends, and I always wondered how the individual pieces worked. When I am not 
          doing school, I love to participate in my student organization Aggie Lemons where 
          we race cheap cars in endurance races. Most of the club's activities end up being 
          us fixing our cars, but that is also very fun for me and my friends. In February 
          I will be the next driver for our upcoming track day, which I am very excited about. 
          Currently, I am looking for a summer of 2025 internship, so if you like what you see 
          on my resume (in the qualifications section), and the rest of the website, feel free 
          to reach out to me using my contact info at the top of the page. After college (or 
          during an internship) I am interested in working in a design verification, ASIC design, 
          or software engineering position, but I am open to other work if the opportunity comes 
          up as long as they are at least mildly interesting. Check out the other pages on this 
          website to learn more about me!
