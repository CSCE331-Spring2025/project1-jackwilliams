                <p>I have loved cars since I was a small child. I find driving to be the most therapeutic
                   and exhilarating experience. I love finding a nice twisty road, going to car shows,
                   and working on cars with my friends. In my student organization, <a href="https://linktr.ee/aggielemons">Aggie Lemons</a>, we 
                   race in endurance races with very cheap cars, and I get to be the next driver for our
                   next trackday.</p>

                <p>I built my first desktop computer to play Apex Legends. I realized that I liked building the computer more than playing the game, and that led me to study computer engineering. I am often helping friends put together part lists, assemble their computer, and troubleshoot problems. Last summer I decided to make some money buy flipping computers on facebook marketplace and was pretty successful.</p>

        <div class="prompt-box_ai">
            <!-- Placeholder for the prompt -->
            Please replicate this picture in html (image attached). This is for a personal website. <br>
            The squiggly lines are supposed to be writing, so leave room for some descriptions. <br>
            The boxes with a car and a computer in them are going to be pictures that I upload. <br>
            Please make room for those too. <br>
            <br>
            (GPT responds)<br>
            <br>
            So this is what you generated (image attached), I would like the car picture <br>
            to be on the left with the description on the right, then do the opposite for <br>
            the building pc's section <br>
            <br>
            (GPT responds)<br>
            <br>
            This is better (image attached), but please make the images bigger and the text<br>
            part less wide. The image should take up half the horizontal space and the paragraph <br>
            should take up the other half<br>
            <br>
            (GPT responds)<br>
            <br>
            you put the "AI" box above all the other things on the top. The main plan is to have <br>
            AI, Service, Jack W, Portfolio, and qualifications all be separate pages on my website, and <br>
            I would like it to be that the box goes around whichever one the user is at, can you make it <br>
            so that the AI box is in line with everything else instead of above?
            <br>
            (GPT responds)<br>
            <br>
            Can you put a big block of text at the top that says, "My Interests"
            <br>
            (GPT responds)<br>
